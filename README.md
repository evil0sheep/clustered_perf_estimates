# About

This repo is a bunch of scripts intended to investigate the theoretical performance bounds on Qwen3-235B-A22B running on a cluster of 4x Ryzen 395 max nodes with 128GB of unified memory and one GPU per node, connected in a dense mesh with a single 50gbps RoCE link per edge. It does not model speculative decoding.
